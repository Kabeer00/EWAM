Electronic Waste Management

PROBLEM STATEMENT
India generates more than 2 million tonnes of e-waste annually, and also imports undisclosed amounts of E-waste from other countries from around the world. 
There are two sectors that handle E-waste disposal and they can be divided into Informal or Formal sectors. The informal recyclers are resourceful enough to extract value at every stage of the recycling process, but this comes with a heavy toll to their health and to the environment. The Formal sector is engaged in handling, recycling and reusing of Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) in eco friendly way. One such formal sector facility in India is the E- Parisaraa Private Limited situated in Bengaluru.
But more than 95% of India’s E-waste is processed by a widely distributed network of informal workers of waste pickers. They are often referred to as “kabadiwalas” or “raddiwalas” who collect, dismantle and recycle it and operate illegally outside of any regulated or formal organisational system. These workers use crude methods to extract reusable components and precious metals such as copper, tin, silver, gold, titanium and palladium. The process involves acid burning and open incineration, creating toxic gases with severe health and environmental consequences.
Thus, there is an urgent need to address this critical situation for efficient E-waste management to take place . Our solution aims to offer exactly this. 
SOLUTION
Our project is aimed at developing an application that intends to increase the flow of E-waste towards the formal sector for its efficient and eco friendly recycling , while integrating the informal sector in the process.
